Create the Project:

Open your terminal.
Run the following command to create a new Express project with EJS as the view engine:
bash
Copy code
express appname --view=ejs
This command sets up a new Express application named appname and configures it to use EJS for rendering views.
Navigate to the Project Directory:

Change into the project directory you just created:
bash
Copy code
cd appname
Install Dependencies:

The express command sets up a basic structure, but you need to install the required Node.js packages. Run:
bash
Copy code
npm install
This command installs all dependencies listed in the package.json file.
Open the Project in Code Editor:

Open the project folder in your preferred code editor (such as Visual Studio Code) using:

code .
This command opens the current directory in Visual Studio Code.
Start Development:

Add Features: Modify and add features to your Express application by editing the files in your code editor.
Run the Application: To run the application locally and see your changes, use:
bash
Copy code
npm start
This command starts the Express server, allowing you to test your application in a web browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if configured).
Additional Packages:

If you need to add additional packages (e.g., nodemailer for sending emails or mongoose for MongoDB integration), install them using:
bash
Copy code
npm install package-name
